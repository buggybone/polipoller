# Status Report 3
* Report 3 covers the week of 12/5.
* **Accomplishments:** Users can upload a list of phone numbers to poll in CSV format. Users can download poll results in CSV format. Site is styled for both mobile and desktop. Bug fixes.
* **Challenges:** I had considerable trouble figuring out the right libraries to use for CSV files. I ended up just creating the CSVs myself by concatenating strings.
* **Goals:** The next step would be to allow users to ask more than simply a yes/no question. Also, payment processing would be useful.
