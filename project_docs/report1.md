# Status Report 1
* Report 1 covers the week of Thanksgiving vacation, when I spun off into my own team.
* **Accomplishments:** Hosting on Heroku is sorted. Postgres database created. Twilio and Chart.js APIs are incorporated. Skeleton of project created with rudimentary html. Sign-in and Sign-up are functional. The database is updated when a poll is submitted. The poll results page actually displays the results stored in the database.
* **Challenges:** Using cookies to pass data from one page to the next. Twilio won't allow a mass text message to be sent.
* **Goals:** Sort out the challenges mentioned above. Get a fully functional website, even though it will be ugly. Making it look pretty will be the final step for next week.
