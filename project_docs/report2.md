# Status Report 2
* Report 2 covers the week of 11/28.
* **Accomplishments:** Users can now create and send their polls to the area code they'd like at the scale they'd like. The text message that is sent contains a URL to a poll, which the person can click and it will take them to a poll page. The poll page, when submitted, updates the database appropriately. The app is more or less functional in this sense.
* **Challenges:** Twilio only allows text messages to "validated numbers", so I need to figure out how to validate a number within the API. There is a bug that occurs that causes the app to crash...it seems to happen 100% of the time my Mom uses the app but 0% of the time I use the app. I need to figure out exactly what she is doing and fix it.
* **Goals:** I need to style the app so that it looks pretty and also make sure it has a different look on mobile. I need to polish the app so that it looks good, and fix any bugs I can find.
