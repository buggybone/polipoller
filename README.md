#Polipoller Project Proposal
*PoliPoller 
*The United States is a representative democracy. Therefore, politicians should be able to quickly and efficiently poll their constituency in order to represent them effectively. There are ways of doing this, such as Twitter or phone polls, but PoliPoller will send a text straight to the constituent's phone and allow them to respond, no accounts necessary.
*The problem will be solved using Twilio to send polls, PostgreSQL to store data, Node.js on the server side, chart.js to display results, Heroku for hosting, and basic HTML5/CSS for styling.
*Users (the politicians) can create an account, log in and out of that account. They can create and send polls. They can view poll results graphically.
*The app will collect anonymous demographic data from those polled, as well as their poll response.
*Simple averaging is all that is needed to display the results. Cheerio will be used to modify HTML documents before they are served.
*Wireframe is forthcoming.
